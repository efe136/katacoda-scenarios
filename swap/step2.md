## Checking Available Space on the Hard Drive Partition

Before we create our swap file, weâ€™ll check our current disk usage to make sure we have enough space. Do this by entering:

`df -h`{{execute}}

The device with / in the Mounted on column is our disk in this case.
Although there are many opinions about the appropriate size of a swap space, it really depends on your personal preferences and your application requirements. Generally, an amount equal to or double the amount of RAM on your system is a good starting point. Another good rule of thumb is that anything over 4G of swap is probably unnecessary if you are just using it as a RAM fallback.

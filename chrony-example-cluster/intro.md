## How To Configure NTP Server Using Chrony on Ubuntu

This tutorial will help you install and configure NTP server using Chrony on Ubuntu.
NTP (Network Time Protocol) is a network protocol that allows for clock synchronization between
computer systems.

Chrony is a versatile implementation of the Network Time Protocol. It has two programs `chrony` and
`chronyd`.

* `chronyd` is a daemon that can be started at boot time
* `chronyc` is a command-line interface program which can be used to monitor chronydâ€™s performance and to change various operating parameters whilst it is running.
